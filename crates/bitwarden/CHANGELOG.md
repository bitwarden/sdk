## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Switched TLS backend to `rustls`, removing the dependency on `OpenSSL`.

## [0.4.0] - 2023-12-21

### Added

- Support for basic state to avoid reauthenticating when creating a new `Client`. This is a breaking
  change because of adding `state_file` to the `AccessTokenLoginRequest` struct. (#388)

### Deprecated

- `client.access_token_login()` is now deprecated and will be removed in a future release. Please
  use `client.auth().login_access_token()` instead. (#319)

## [0.3.1] - 2023-10-13

### Changed

- `auth::request::AccessTokenLoginRequest` moved to `auth::login::AccessTokenLoginRequest` (#178)
- Support for fetching multiple secrets by ids (#150)

## [0.3.0] - 2023-07-26

### Deprecated

- The secrets manager SDK is now hidden behind a `secrets` feature flag. Make sure to enable this
  flag in your `Cargo.toml` file. At the moment the flag is enabled by default for compatibility
  reasons, but this is considered deprecated and the flag will be made opt-in eventually.

### Added

- Support for creating and editing secrets (#77)
- Support for creating and editing projects (#53)
